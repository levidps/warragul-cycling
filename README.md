# Warragul CC Routes

Personal project to explore React+Vite+Cloudflare (workers/pages) and assemble various local routes, group rides and give a forecast.

## Roadmap/Ideas
- Vary color based on current weather (or forecast for selected future day)
  â€¢ has been accounted for using HSL css with variables allowing for dynamic changing of colour while ensuring saturation and lightness are optimized for viewing.
- Suggested "effort" based on route and direction along with wind direction, temp, percip give rough idea of motivation required for ride
- Local group rides: show distance, speed, time
- Improve cloudflare workers by implementing CLI to test locally and deploy updates
