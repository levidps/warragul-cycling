## Roadmap/Ideas
- Improve color mapping for weather conditions
  â€¢ jump from cool/mid to temperate feels drastic
- Suggested "effort" based on route and direction along with wind direction, temp, percip give rough idea of motivation required for ride
- Local group rides: show distance, speed, time
- Improve cloudflare workers by implementing CLI to test locally and deploy updates
